question 1
A. Write a function called, SelectionSort which receives an array of size n and sorts the array using the "selection sort" algorithm as follows:
• Look for the minimum member in the array and replace it with the member that is in place 0 in the array.
• Look for the minimum limb in the sub-array from the limb in place 1 to the last limb and replace it with the limb in place 1.
• Look for the minimum limb in the sub-array from the limb in the 2nd place to the last limb and replace it with the limb in the 2nd place.
• Continue like this until the right limb is inserted in place n-2.
B. Write a function called, RemoveDup which gets an n-sized array of integers. The function must remove recurring members from the array by moving the remaining members.
third. The program must define the size of the array using #define, declare the array, organize the input of the array members, sort it using the SelectionSort function, print the sorted array, run the RemoveDup function on the array, and print the contents of the updated array (only organs not removed , Ie those not marked with an X in the example in the previous section) as well as the value returned by RemoveDup.

Question 2
Write an efficient function that takes a two-dimensional array with n rows and m columns of integers. The physical number of the columns will be given by a constant named COLS. It must be set before the function using #define.

The function returns 2 if both all rows and columns of the array are sorted in ascending order (sorting in ascending order is defined from the limb with the minimum index to the limb with the maximum index).
The function returns 1 if all rows (but not all columns) of the array are sorted in ascending order or if all columns (but not all rows) of the array are sorted in ascending order.
The function will return 0 in all other cases.


Question 3
Write a plan that finds and prints the prime numbers in the range of 1000-1000 using the Arthrosthens cobra algorithm.
