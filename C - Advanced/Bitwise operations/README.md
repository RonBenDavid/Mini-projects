1. Write a function that receives a number (unsigned int) and counts how many bits are in the number.

For example for the following number:
10010111 11110011 00100010 00001010
The function will return: 15.


2. Write a function that receives a number (unsigned int) and returns its length.

For example for the following number:
00000000 00000000 00000001 01001010
The function will return: 9.


3. Write a function that receives a number (unsigned int) and checks whether it contains a certain pattern (whether a binary number "contains" another binary number) It can be assumed that a pattern is not equal to 0.

For example: 01001010 "contains" 1001
Note: The number of options in which the pattern number can appear is:
32 - length (pattern) + 1

4. Write a function that receives a number (unsigned int) and returns a duplication of digits over 32 bits.

For example: 1011
The function will return:
10111011 10111011 10111011 10111011








5. Write a function that receives a number (unsigned int), location and template.
The function must write the template in the required location.

For example for the following number:
10010111 11110011 00100010 00001010
Position 13 and template: 11011

The function will return:
10010111 11110011 10110010 00001010
