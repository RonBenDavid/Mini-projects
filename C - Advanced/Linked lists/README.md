question 1

A. Calculating the length of a recursively linked list;
B. Check whether a two-way linked list is a polynomial.


Question 2

An algorithm must be developed and implemented which receives a two-way linked list of natural numbers and also a natural number k. Before each organ whose organ content is divided by k, an organ with a content of 0 must be inserted.

For example, to k = 3 and the original list 6 5 8 9 24 13 3 (from left to right) will become
0 6 5 8 0 9 0 24 13 0 3 (from left to right).

The algorithm must use the InsertBefore function.


Question 3

An algorithm must be developed and implemented which receives a linked list of characters and deletes repeating elements from it.

For example, the original list abaabcbabc (left to right) will become abc (left to right).
